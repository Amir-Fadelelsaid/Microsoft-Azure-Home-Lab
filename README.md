# Microsoft-Azure-Home-Lab
I built a cloud-based cybersecurity lab in Azure using Microsoft Sentinel to detect and analyze threats. It includes VMs, security logs, KQL queries, and GeoIP mapping. The lab simulates real-world attacks like brute-force attempts, helping me practice SOC skills, automate security tasks, and improve threat detection.
## Windows VM Attack Map Workbook
This workbook visualizes failed login attempts (Event ID 4625) on a map using GeoIP data.
To import, go to Microsoft Sentinel > Workbooks > Import and upload Windows_VM_Attack_Map.json.
